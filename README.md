# Diligent Tech Test

## Assumptions 

- You've provided both a design reference, as well as a prompt to use Material UI, so I'll mostly take the design reference as a high-level sketch, and rely on Material Design components to fulfill functional needs. If however, my CSS skills are of high interest to you, I'd be glad to provide a few refernece projects where no design library was used
- I will assume that data does not need to persisted anywhere (be it a server, or the client)


## How to run

## Improvements

- Tests
- Responsive design
- Could always improve on the search with an external service e.g. (MeiliSearch)
- Virtualized table for performance in case of large dataset
